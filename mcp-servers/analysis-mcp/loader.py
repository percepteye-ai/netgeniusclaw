"""Dataset discovery: which files this surface may load, and which it must never touch.

R17's constraint is a **denylist in the roadmap** ("must not expose `~/.openclaw/memory/` or
`~/.openclaw/rag/rag.db`"), but a denylist is the wrong shape to implement. New stores appear
— feature 033 added the memory store, 062 added RAG, 052 added `federation.db` — and a
denylist silently fails open for whatever arrives next.

So this is an **allowlist of roots**, and the denied paths are additionally checked so that a
misconfiguration cannot quietly re-admit them. Two mechanisms rather than one, because the
consequence of getting it wrong is a backdoor onto the operator's own memory.

    Passing names here removes the statement rather than escaping it: every name goes
