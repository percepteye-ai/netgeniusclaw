# Specification Quality Checklist: Push Notifications, Unread Tracking & Cross-Device Sync for NetGeniusClaw Mobile

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All ambiguity that would otherwise have needed `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers was already resolved
  conversationally before drafting (push-delivery model, unread scope, acknowledge-vs-delete semantics,
  voice-playback mode, and notification-action authentication) — recorded directly as FR-004, FR-008,
  FR-009, FR-010, FR-012/FR-013, and FR-017/FR-018 rather than left open.
- Several requirements deliberately reference existing architecture decisions from specs 066/067/072
  (e.g., FR-010's WatchConnectivity `sendMessage`-only constraint, FR-016's shared `ConversationStore`)
  by name — this project's established convention across specs 066-072 is to cross-reference prior
  specs' concrete decisions explicitly, since this is an iterative extension of an existing, already-built
  system rather than a greenfield product spec.
