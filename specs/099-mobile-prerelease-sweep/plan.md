# Implementation Plan: Mobile Pre-Release Hardening & Expansion Sweep

**Branch**: `099-mobile-prerelease-sweep` | **Date**: 2026-08-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/099-mobile-prerelease-sweep/spec.md`

## Summary

Eight-story pre-release sweep of the NetGeniusClaw mobile app (Flutter phone app + Swift watch app). Fixes a real defect (stuck notification badge never reconciled on launch/resume), closes App Store submission blockers not gated on the developer's pending paid Apple Developer account, wires the paid-account-gated push/signing/submission-scaffold work so it activates cleanly once that account exists, adds a CI gate for a codebase that currently has none, and adds four new experience surfaces (Dashboard as the new default landing tab, Lock Screen Live Activity, watch complication) — **except rich notification actions (Story 6), which Phase 0 research found are already fully implemented** in spec 073's `local_notifications.dart`/`approval_confirmation.dart`/`main.dart` (biometric-gated Approve/Deny notification actions routed through the same `confirmAndResolve` path as the in-app buttons). That story's tasks are re-scoped to verification and test-coverage closure, not new implementation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Dart 3.x / Flutter (SDK constraint `^3.12.2`, matching `mobile/netclaw-mobile/pubspec.yaml`); Swift 5.0 (existing `ios/Runner/*.swift`, `ios/WatchApp Watch App/*.swift`); Bash (CI workflow is declarative YAML, no new scripting language)
**Primary Dependencies**: No new Dart packages — reuses `flutter_local_notifications`, `firebase_messaging`, `firebase_core`, `local_auth`, `app_links`, `web_socket_channel`, `flutter_secure_storage` already in `pubspec.yaml`. New native-only surface: Apple's **ActivityKit** (Live Activity, Story 7) and **WidgetKit** (watchOS complication, Story 8) — both system frameworks, zero new third-party dependencies, consistent with every prior mobile spec (066-073) adding no new packages beyond what a given story strictly needs.
**Storage**: N/A — reuses existing on-device stores (`MessageFeedStore`, `ConversationStore`, `ApprovalClient` in-memory state, `flutter_secure_storage` for enrollment) for Dashboard data; no new persistence introduced.
**Testing**: `flutter_test` + `integration_test` (existing, ~25 files); XCTest (native — currently only the unmodified Xcode placeholder in `ios/RunnerTests/RunnerTests.swift`, this spec adds the first real native test)
**Target Platform**: iOS (bumping `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` from the current 15.0 to **16.2** — the `ActivityContent`-based ActivityKit API this app uses is gated there in the current SDK, discovered mid-implementation; see research.md R2 — acceptable pre-release since there are no existing users on older iOS to strand); watchOS 10.0 (unchanged — already WidgetKit-based, sufficient for complications)
**Project Type**: Mobile app (existing `mobile/netclaw-mobile/` Flutter project with iOS native `ios/Runner/` + `ios/WatchApp Watch App/` targets) — this spec extends that single project, it does not introduce a new project
**Performance Goals**: Badge/Dashboard/complication reconciliation must complete within a few seconds of the triggering event (launch, resume, sync) — matches spec SC-001/SC-005, no new numeric target beyond what's already implied by "at a glance"
**Constraints**: No regression to existing enrollment/chat/feed/approvals/capture flows (spec FR-020); paid-account-gated work (Story 3) must not block or degrade current free/Personal-team builds (FR-007); CI must run on GitHub-hosted `macos-14` runners (needed for any Xcode build step) — noted as a real per-minute cost consideration, not a blocker
**Scale/Scope**: 8 user stories, ~4 modified Dart files (badge lifecycle), ~6 new/modified native config files (entitlements, Info.plist, privacy manifest, ExportOptions.plist), 2 new Xcode targets (Widget Extension for Live Activity, watch Complication extension), 1 new CI workflow file, 1 new top-level screen (Dashboard)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

This feature does not add an MCP server, skill, or network-device-facing integration, so the constitution's device-automation gates (I, II, III, VIII, IX) and the MCP-specific gates (V, VI, XI's catalog/install-steps/HUD touchpoints) are **not applicable** — there is no `catalog.sh` entry, `install-steps.sh` function, or Three.js HUD node for a mobile-app UI change. Applicable principles:

- **XVI (Spec-Driven Development)** — ✅ satisfied: this plan follows specify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement, spec is ratified with no open `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.
- **XV (Backwards Compatibility)** — ✅ addressed directly by FR-020 and the "no new third-party packages" constraint above; re-verified in Phase 1 design below.
- **XIII (Credential Safety)** — ✅ no new secrets introduced; signing identity/entitlements are Xcode project configuration, not application secrets, and nothing here touches `.env`.
- **IV (Immutable Audit Trail)** — N/A as a design gate for this feature's artifacts (no device/GAIT-relevant operations performed by the mobile app itself); the development *session* producing this work still owes a GAIT summary commit per standing practice — tracked explicitly as tasks.md T042 rather than left as an unverified assumption (analyze finding C1).
- **XVII (Milestone Documentation)** — deferred to post-implementation: a WordPress blog post draft is owed once `/speckit.implement` completes, tracked as a final task, not a design gate.

No violations requiring the Complexity Tracking table below.

```

**Structure Decision**: Everything extends the existing single Flutter+iOS mobile project at `mobile/netclaw-mobile/`; no new top-level project is created. The two genuinely new pieces of Xcode project structure (a Widget Extension target for Story 7, a Complication extension embedded in the existing WatchApp for Story 8) follow the same target-addition pattern spec 072 already established for `WatchApp` itself, and Phase 0 research explicitly captures the pitfalls that surfaced during that prior addition so they aren't repeated.
