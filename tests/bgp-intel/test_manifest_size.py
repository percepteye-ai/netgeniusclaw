"""Manifest token budget. Spec 081, FR-027a/b/c, SC-020a.

HARD CEILING: 5,000 tokens for the entire `tools/list` response.

This exists because the manifest is loaded into EVERY conversation whether or not
Fortinet is in play, so its cost is paid by every unrelated task. The clarification
that set the number rejected "don't make it too big" as untestable.

It is also why this server has ~21 parameterised tools instead of mirroring the
community servers, which ship 106 (FortiManager), 69 (FortiAnalyzer) and 204+
(FortiOS) — any one of which blows the budget several times over on its own.

Counting: the SERVING MODEL's own tokenizer when a model server is reachable
(`netclaw_tokens.counter`, which asks it directly), otherwise a conservative
character-based estimate. The estimate is deliberately pessimistic so a passing
local run cannot be an optimistic one.

Runs with NO appliance.
