# NetGeniusClaw Mobile — Android tester instructions

Copy the **"Send this to your tester"** section below verbatim. Do the
operator steps first — the tester can't do anything without the QR.

> **Building the APK itself is in [`SIDELOAD.md`](SIDELOAD.md)**, along with the
> iOS routes (there is no iOS equivalent of emailing an APK). This document
> assumes you already have an artifact to send.
>
> With a **Personal** Play developer account you need **twelve** testers opted
> in for fourteen continuous days before you can apply for production — so this
> handout is on the critical path to publishing, not just a courtesy. See
> [`PLAY-STORE-ROADMAP.md`](PLAY-STORE-ROADMAP.md) Phase 4.

## Operator steps (you, before sending anything)

**1. Confirm the edge listener is up and reachable.**

```bash
journalctl --user -u netclaw-mesh.service -n 50 --no-pager | grep -i "Edge"
# → Edge (NetGeniusClaw Mobile) WS listener on 0.0.0.0:8443 (risk=johns-risk)
```

Your tester will be on their own network or cellular, so port 8443 must be
reachable from the public internet — not just your LAN. Verify from outside
before blaming the app.

**2. Issue a fresh single-use token, labelled for that person.**

```bash
./scripts/netclaw risk token --edge <their-name>-android
```

Screenshot the QR block it prints. Do **not** reuse a token from an earlier
run — they are single-use, and any token that has been pasted into a chat log
or terminal transcript should be considered spent.

**3. Send them the APK and the QR** (see the handout below).

**4. After they enroll, confirm the device is really theirs:**

```bash
./scripts/netclaw risk members
```

Check the label and key fingerprint before the device is used for anything
real. Trust-on-first-use means whoever claims the token first wins the
identity — this is the step that catches a wrong claim.

**5. When testing is done, or immediately if the phone is lost:**

```bash
./scripts/netclaw risk remove <member_id>
```

Revocation is server-side; you don't need the phone back.

> **The APK is signed with the Android debug key.** That's fine for sideloading
> and expected at this stage, but it is not a Play-uploadable artifact and the
> tester's phone will warn them it's from an unknown developer. See
> `PLAY-STORE-ROADMAP.md`.

## Send this to your tester

> **Testing NetGeniusClaw Mobile — about 5 minutes**
>
> This is an early Android build of NetGeniusClaw Mobile. It turns your phone into a
> secure remote for my NetGeniusClaw network-automation agent — you ask it a question
> in plain English, it does the work on my side and sends the answer back.
>
> You'll need the APK file and the QR code image I sent alongside this.
>
> **1. Install the app**
>
> - Tap the `app-release.apk` file I sent you.
> - Android will say installs from this source aren't allowed — tap
>   **Settings**, turn on **Allow from this source**, then go back and tap
>   **Install**.
> - You may get a "scan app / unsafe app blocked" warning from Play Protect.
>   This is expected for an app that isn't on the Play Store yet — choose
>   **Install anyway** / **More details → Install anyway**.
> - Open **NetGeniusClaw** from your app drawer.
>
> **2. Enroll it against my server**
>
> The app opens on a screen with a **Scan Border QR Code** button.
>
> - Tap it and allow camera access when asked.
> - Point the camera at the QR code image I sent. Displaying it full-screen on
>   a computer monitor works best.
>
> If the camera won't focus or the scan doesn't catch, tap **"Can't scan? Enter
> manually"** and type in the three values I sent with the QR (Border domain,
> Port, Enrollment token). That does exactly the same thing.
>
> It should connect within a few seconds and take you to the main screen with
> tabs along the bottom: **Chat**, **Feed**, **Approvals**, **Settings**.
>
> **3. Try it**
>
> On the **Chat** tab, send:
>
> ```
> Check the CML lab R1 interfaces and report back
> ```
>
> It takes about **2 minutes** — the request goes to my Border, which farms the
> work out to the lab tooling and sends the answer back. You'll see it working
> while it runs. You should get a table of interfaces and their status.
>
> Then try one of your own, anything about the network.
>
> **4. Tell me**
>
> - Did the install and QR scan work, or did you have to type it manually?
> - Did the answer come back? Roughly how long?
> - Anything confusing, ugly, or broken — including wording and layout.
> - Phone model and Android version.
>
> **A few things to know**
>
> - The QR contains a **single-use token**. It only works once, so don't share
>   it — if the install fails partway, tell me and I'll issue a new one.
> - The app can only ask my agent questions. It has no access to your phone's
>   files, contacts, or anything else, and it can't be used to reach anything
>   other than my server.
> - Push notifications aren't wired up yet, so answers only arrive while the
>   app is open.
> - I can cut this phone off from my end at any time — just say when you're
>   done and I'll revoke it.

## Known rough edges (don't be surprised when they're reported)

| Behavior | Status |
|---|---|
| Play Protect warns on install | Expected — unsigned-for-Play debug key |
| No push notifications | Firebase project not configured yet. No longer *silent*: the Settings tab now says "Notifications unavailable" and explains why. Drop in `google-services.json` to enable — see `README.md`. |
| Tapping a notification doesn't deep-link | **Fixed (spec 107)** — the tap now opens the message it names even when that message has not arrived yet. It used to search the local feed once, the instant the app opened, which could never win against the message's own arrival: a replayed message lands ~3s after channel auth (Border-side replay settle), and a cold launch from a tap finishes well inside that. The tap now records the message it wants and opens it on arrival, giving up after 8s. |
| A pushed message wasn't visible until the app reconnected | **Fixed (spec 107)** — the push payload already carried the whole message; nothing on the device read it. Now recorded on receipt, so it renders without waiting for (or having) a live connection. Foreground only: background delivery is at the OS's discretion, and a push that arrives while backgrounded still reaches the feed via the Border's replay. |
| Biometric approval untested on real hardware | Never exercised outside an emulator without enrolled biometrics |
| Camera capture untested on real hardware | Emulator only produced a synthetic test pattern |
| Voice input untested on real hardware | Never exercised against a real microphone |

A real device exercising biometrics, camera, and voice is the single most
valuable thing this tester can give you — those are the three features with no
real-hardware verification at all.
