# Specification Quality Checklist: Globalping Global Probe Measurement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Endpoint names are unavoidable here.** FR-001 names the remote MCP URL and FR-002 names the token variable.
Normally that would be an implementation detail, but this feature's *entire substance* is "register this
specific third-party endpoint" — a spec that avoided naming it would be describing nothing. Same reasoning
applies to the measured `no_probes_found` / `AS13335` facts: they are properties of the external contract the
feature must accommodate, not choices NetGeniusClaw makes.

**Every figure in the spec was measured, not cited.** The 500/hour budget, the 250/hour anonymous limit, the
one-call-one-measurement accounting, 4,833 probes across 1,390 ASNs, and each location-syntax result come from
live calls on 2026-07-31 (see [research.md](../research.md)).

**Four starting assumptions turned out wrong** and are corrected in place rather than quietly dropped:

1. "12 tools" is the capability → **5 measurement tools**; 6 of 12 take only `context`.
2. An unresolved "location syntax bug" → **two conflated issues**: comma-in-string genuinely fails, while
   `AS13335` is correct syntax with no probes — and it is the vendor's own documented example.
3. Rate limits work per call → **charged per probe**: `limit: 20` spends 20 of 500. Research R4 got this wrong on first pass (it concluded per-call billing from a coincidental arithmetic match) and a controlled test corrected it. The wrong version had already reached the spec, skill and tasks; all were corrected and the error is recorded in R4 rather than overwritten.
4. Unanticipated entirely: a **mandatory natural-language analytics field** ships operator intent to a third
   party, and is **not actually enforced**.

**Principle XIV needed a decision, not a checkmark.** The `context` field transmits operator intent
externally. Resolved in plan.md as disclosure-plus-sanitisation rather than a per-call gate, since gating
every ping would make the integration unusable and train operators to click through. Recorded because "it's
just analytics" is exactly the reasoning that would let a customer name leave the building.
