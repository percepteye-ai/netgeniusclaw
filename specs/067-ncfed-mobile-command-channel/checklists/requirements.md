# Specification Quality Checklist: NCFED Mobile Command Channel

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is Direction 2 of 3 in the NetGeniusClaw Mobile initiative (spec 066 = foundation/push,
  067 = this spec/command channel, 068 = biometrics/capture).
- A `/speckit.clarify` pass on 2026-07-22 resolved three questions the initial draft left
  ambiguous: (1) a phone-originated request inherits the operator's own local trust for
  in-risk work rather than needing its own per-device grant (verified against
  `authorization.py`, where grants are keyed to peer identity — a real fork this spec needed
  to resolve explicitly, FR-002), (2) conversation history is independent per enrolled
  device with no cross-device sync (FR-007), and (3) in-progress requests are cancellable
  from the phone via the existing task-cancellation mechanism (FR-012).
- A device-status QR/deep-link feature (User Story 5, FR-011) was added after initial
  drafting — it existed in an earlier, pre-split version of this initiative's plan and was
  dropped by accident during the three-way spec split; it belongs here, not in 066 or 068,
  since it's a shortcut for submitting a request.
- FR-005 (answer attribution) exists because a phone-originated request can be answered by
  three different sources (Border, in-risk member, external peer) and the spec treats
  ambiguity about which one actually answered as a real defect, not a cosmetic detail — this
  is the same "no fabricated source" discipline features 064/065 already apply to federated
  knowledge answers, applied here to federated command answers.
- Streaming vs. staged responses was deliberately left as an Assumption, not a
  clarification: reusing the existing task-result polling shape is a clear, low-risk default
  that doesn't foreclose adding streaming later.
