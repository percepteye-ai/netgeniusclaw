"""The DuckDB sandbox: allowlisted datasets in, nothing out.

Roadmap R17 carries a hard constraint: a SQL surface **must not** expose
`~/.openclaw/memory/` or `~/.openclaw/rag/rag.db`. A generic SQL engine is a backdoor to the
whole filesystem — `read_csv('/etc/passwd')`, `ATTACH '…/rag.db'`, `COPY … TO '/tmp/exfil'`,
`INSTALL httpfs` then read over the network. Blocking those by inspecting query strings is a
losing game: SQL has too many spellings, and the one you miss is the one that matters.

So containment here is enforced **by DuckDB, not by pattern matching**. The sequence is:

1. Materialise each allowlisted dataset into a real TABLE.
2. `SET enable_external_access=false` — every filesystem and network operation now fails.
3. `SET lock_configuration=true` — and that setting can no longer be turned back on.

Measured after step 3 (see specs/092-duckdb-analysis/spec.md, Verification): reading
`/etc/passwd`, globbing `/home/**`, attaching `rag.db`, attaching the memory store,
`COPY … TO`, `INSTALL`/`LOAD`, re-enabling `enable_external_access`, and unlocking the
configuration **all raise**. The materialised tables remain fully queryable.

One write is NOT covered by step 2/3, and this used to say it was. DuckDB spills
intermediate results to `temp_directory`, which defaults to the RELATIVE path `.tmp`
and is bounded by `max_temp_directory_size` — 90% of available disk by default. That
write survives lockdown: measured on duckdb 1.5.5, a heavy query still creates
`.tmp/duckdb_temp_storage_*` in the process's working directory AFTER
`enable_external_access=false` and `lock_configuration=true`. Since the query surface
is the untrusted one, that was an unbounded analyst-triggerable write into wherever
the server was launched. `Sandbox.__init__` now points `temp_directory` at a private
0700 directory and caps it; both must be set before the lock, which is also what makes
them unchangeable afterwards.

One thing this forced, and it is worth stating plainly: a **VIEW does not survive the
lockdown.** Views are evaluated lazily, so a view over a CSV re-opens the file at query time
and fails once the door is shut. Datasets must be materialised, which bounds memory by the
data loaded — hence the row cap in `loader.py`. That trade is the price of enforcement that
does not depend on me writing a perfect regex.
