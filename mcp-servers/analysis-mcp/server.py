"""analysis-mcp — read-only DuckDB analysis over exported network data (roadmap R17).

Ad-hoc SQL over the files NetClaw's own tooling produces: Zeek TSV logs and Suricata
`eve.json` from `nsm-mcp` (spec 091), and generated reports under the workspace output
directory. **Read-only, and sandboxed by DuckDB itself rather than by string matching.**

R17 was explicitly blocked until something produced bulk exports -- surveyed on 2026-08-04
there were *zero* parquet files anywhere and no DuckDB installed, so the roadmap's own note
said building the query layer first "would ship a query engine with nothing to point at."
Spec 091 (R13) produced the data, which is what unblocked this.

The security model, which is the substance of this server:

    load allowlisted datasets as materialised TABLEs
    SET enable_external_access=false      -- all filesystem and network paths close
    SET lock_configuration=true           -- and cannot be reopened

After that DuckDB refuses `read_csv('/etc/passwd')`, `glob('/home/**')`, `ATTACH` of the
memory or RAG stores, `COPY … TO`, `INSTALL`/`LOAD`, and any attempt to re-enable access.
Verified, not assumed -- see specs/092-duckdb-analysis/spec.md, Verification. That is how R17's
"must not expose ~/.openclaw/memory/ or rag.db" is honoured: structurally, not by a regex.
