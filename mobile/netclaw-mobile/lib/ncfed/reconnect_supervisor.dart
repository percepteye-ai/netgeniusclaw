/// Ports `_in2n_member_dialer`'s exact backoff bounds (`bgp-daemon-v2.py`,
/// research D4) to Dart: there is no missing Python reconnect capability to
/// build here, only a port, since Dart and Python code cannot literally be
/// shared (D4). Drives any `dial()` callback that produces a connection of
/// type `T` (or throws); this class knows nothing about WebSockets, NCFED,
/// or `EdgeClient` — it is the same generic bounded-retry shape whether
/// wired to `EdgeClient.enroll` or `EdgeClient.reconnect` (US1/US3), and is
/// directly testable (T034) without a real connection type at all.
///
/// Faithfully replicates a subtlety in the original: `_in2n_member_dialer`
/// doubles `backoff` *before* sleeping on it each failed attempt (the log
/// line reports the pre-doubling value, but `asyncio.sleep(backoff)` runs
/// after the reassignment) — so the FIRST retry after a failure actually
/// waits 10s, not `initialBackoff` (5s); the sequence on repeated failure is
/// 10s, 20s, 40s, 60s, 60s... `initialBackoff` is what a freshly-reset
/// counter starts at before its first doubling, matching the source exactly.
