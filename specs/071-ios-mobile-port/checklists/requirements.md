# Specification Quality Checklist: iOS Port Verification and App Store Roadmap for NetGeniusClaw Mobile

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- File paths (e.g. `ios/Runner/EdgeIdentityPlugin.swift`, `PLAY-STORE-ROADMAP.md`) appear as *targets to verify or update*, not as prescribed implementation — this feature is inherently a verification/documentation effort against existing, already-written code, so referencing it by name is necessary for scope, not a spec-quality violation.
- All items pass on first pass; no clarification round needed.
