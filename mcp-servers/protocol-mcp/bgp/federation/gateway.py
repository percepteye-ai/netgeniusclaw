"""Run a local gateway agent turn for N2N delegated chat / skill execution.

OpenClaw's gateway (2026.6+) is WebSocket-only — it does NOT serve an
OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` REST route. The gateway (default,
non-embedded) dispatch path in this module talks to the gateway's `agent` RPC
method over a persistent WebSocket connection (see gateway_ws.py), the same
way OpenClaw's own internal `sessions_send` tool does.

Spec 116: this module used to shell out to the `openclaw agent --json` CLI for
every single turn. That CLI's own gateway-dispatch code unconditionally sets
`cleanupBundleMcpOnRunEnd: true`, which tears down the gateway's
session-scoped MCP tool runtime after every turn — a measured ~27s fixed cost
on every single turn, every channel, with zero reuse even within one session
(specs/116-border-turn-latency/research.md). The WS RPC path never sends that
flag, so the gateway's own runtime cache is finally allowed to do its job.

The reply envelope shape (`result.payloads[*].text`) is identical whether it
arrives via CLI stdout or a WS response payload — `_extract_reply` (CLI) and
`_extract_reply_from_ws_payload` (WS) share the same parsing core.

The embedded (`local=True`) path is unchanged by spec 116: it still shells out
to `openclaw agent --local ...` directly (feature 056 — an iN2N MEMBER runs
in-process with its own provider keys and no gateway at all, so there is no
gateway RPC to dispatch through).

    Two modes:
      - gateway (default): a persistent WebSocket JSON-RPC connection to the
        running gateway's `agent` method (spec 116 — previously an `openclaw
        agent --agent <id> …` CLI subprocess per turn; see gateway_ws.py's
        module docstring and specs/116-border-turn-latency/research.md for
        why that was replaced: the CLI path forced a ~27s full MCP-tool-set
        rebuild on every single turn). Used by the Border / a standalone claw
        (eN2N responder).
      - embedded (local=True): `openclaw agent --local --model <model> …` — the
        agent runs in-process with the member's own provider API keys and ONLY
        the MCP servers in the member's config dir. This is how an iN2N MEMBER
        executes a delegated skill: no gateway, no comms, scoped tools, its own
        model/provider (feature 056). `model` is 'provider/model' or a model id.
        UNCHANGED by spec 116 — still dispatches via CLI subprocess.

    `untrusted` marks the prompt as carrying EXTERNAL (eN2N) peer input. An
    untrusted turn may NEVER run embedded outside verified production
    containment: embedded mode has no gateway scope-approval gate and no gateway
    session log, so for an external peer it is only acceptable inside the
    sandbox + model guard, both fail-closed (2026-07-14 delegation-bypass
    security review).

    `on_stall(waited_s)` (gateway mode only): called once if the turn produces
    no result within `stall_after_s` — the signature of the gateway holding the
    session at its scope-upgrade approval gate. It may return extra seconds to
    wait (e.g. the operator approval window) so an approval can land instead of
    the turn dying on a blind hard timeout.

    Raises TimeoutError on timeout.

    `message_file` (feature 068): when set, the message body is read from this
    path instead of using `prompt` directly. In embedded (CLI) mode this
    avoids Linux ARG_MAX on a large capture attachment (research 068-D3); in
    gateway (WS) mode there is no ARG_MAX constraint, but the file is still
    read and its content used as the message body, for parity. `prompt` is
    still required and is what `_apply_production_controls` inspects (embedded
    mode only); the file's content is expected to match it.

    `origin` (spec 116, FR-007): optional marker for where the request
    originated (currently only `"voice"` is recognized). Default `None` is
    fully backward compatible (FR-008) — every existing caller that does not
    pass this argument sees identical behavior to before spec 116. An
    unrecognized value is normalized to `None` rather than failing the request
    (FR-012). Gateway (WS) mode only; the embedded path does not use it.
