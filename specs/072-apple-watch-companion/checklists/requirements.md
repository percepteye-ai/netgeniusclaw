# Specification Quality Checklist: Apple Watch Companion App for NetGeniusClaw Mobile

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-014 and the Key Entities reference the existing iOS Xcode project and phone-side stores by
  name — this is a necessary scope/feasibility fact (Flutter has no watchOS target at all), not a
  prescribed implementation choice, matching the same pattern spec 071's own checklist accepted.
- The two highest-impact architectural forks (relay-through-phone vs. standalone watch identity;
  which capabilities to build) were already resolved with the operator before this spec was
  written — captured in the Assumptions section rather than as open [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.
- All items pass on first pass; no clarification round needed against this checklist, though the
  watch's on-device confirmation mechanism (FR-003/FR-004) is flagged for a dedicated clarify pass
  given its security-relevant nature.
