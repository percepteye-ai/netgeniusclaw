# Zabbix Problem Review

## Server

`zabbix-mcp` — vendored third-party, read-only, three tools. See
[zabbix-metrics-history](../zabbix-metrics-history/SKILL.md) for the shared cautions.

## Current problems vs history — use the right one

| Question | Method | Note |
|---|---|---|
| What is wrong **now**? | **`problem.get`** | Reads a dedicated problem table. This is the right one |
| What happened **then**? | `event.get` | Historical, heavier, needs a time window |
| What rule fired it? | `trigger.get` | The definition behind a problem |

```jsonc
zabbix_api("problem.get", {
  "output": "extend", "selectAcknowledges": "extend", "selectTags": "extend",
  "recent": false, "sortfield": ["eventid"], "sortorder": "DESC"
})
```

Every problem you report carries: **severity · host · when it started · how long it has been active ·
acknowledgement state**. "How long" is the question NetGeniusClaw could not answer at all before this integration
existed — do not drop it.

## The distinction that matters most here

> ### "No active problems" and "the NMS could not be reached" are not the same answer.

An empty problem list is a **legitimate, positive finding** — the monitoring system looked and found
nothing wrong. An unreachable NMS is a **failure to look**.

They are both an empty result over the wire, and reporting the second as the first is the most misleading
thing this skill can do: it tells an engineer everything is fine at exactly the moment monitoring is blind.

Three outcomes, three different sentences:

| | Say |
|---|---|
| NMS reachable, nothing wrong | *"Zabbix reports no active problems as of \<time>."* |
| NMS unreachable | *"Zabbix could not be reached — this is not a statement about the network."* |
| Credentials rejected | *"Zabbix rejected the credentials — the monitoring state is unknown."* |

## Acknowledgement is a workflow fact, never a resolution

An acknowledged problem is **still happening**. Someone has said "I've seen this", which is a fact about the
team, not about the network.

Report it as *"active, acknowledged by \<who> at \<when>"*. Never let acknowledgement soften the description
of the underlying condition, and never let a filtered-out acknowledged problem disappear from a count.

## Filtering

Filter **before** you answer — by severity, host or group — rather than returning everything and asking the
reader to ignore rows. Use `severities`, `hostids` or `groupids` on the call.

Severities: 0 not classified · 1 information · 2 warning · 3 average · 4 high · 5 disaster.

When you filter, **say what you filtered out**, so "two problems" is never mistaken for "two problems exist".

## Resolved problems

`event.get` with `value: 0` gives resolutions. Report **both** onset and resolution times — a problem that
lasted four minutes and one that lasted four hours are different incidents, and the duration is usually the
point of the question.

## Boundaries

| Want to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Metric values over time | `zabbix-metrics-history` |
| Availability and inventory | `zabbix-availability` |
| Unsolicited traps | `snmptrap-mcp` — push, not poll |
| Flows | `ipfix-mcp` |
| Instrumented metrics / dashboards | `prometheus`, `grafana` |
| SaaS monitoring | `auvik`, `thousandeyes`, `datadog` |
| Current device state | `pyats`, `multivendor-cli`, `fortinet` — this is the poller's view over time |
| Acknowledge, close or suppress anything | **nothing here.** This integration is strictly read-only |

## Rules

1. **Never report an unreachable NMS as "no problems".**
2. **Always give duration**, not just onset.
3. **Acknowledged ≠ resolved.** Say "acknowledged", never imply "handled".
4. **Say what you filtered out.**
5. **Read-only.** Acknowledging an alert is a real action a human owns; there is no write path here.
