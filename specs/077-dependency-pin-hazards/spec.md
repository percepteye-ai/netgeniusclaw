# Feature Specification: Dependency-Pin Hazards

**Feature Branch**: `077-dependency-pin-hazards`
**Created**: 2026-07-31
**Status**: Draft
**Roadmap item**: R0a in `docs/COVERAGE-ROADMAP.md`
**Builds on**: R0 / spec 075 (the reconciliation gate this feature extends), R1 / spec 076 (where all three hazards were found)

---

## The problem, in one sentence

**NetGeniusClaw installs correctly today and would fail to install tomorrow**, because three classes of
dependency breakage are invisible to every existing check — and all three break only *new* installs,
which is exactly why nobody noticed.

This directly undermines R0's ratified goal: *"all 89 available for people when they install their own
risk."* R0 made integrations *registered and catalogued*. It did not make them *installable next
Tuesday*.

## Measured state (audited 2026-07-31)

### Hazard 1 — `mcp 2.0.0` removed `mcp.server.fastmcp`

Verified directly: the `mcp 2.0.0` wheel contains **zero** `mcp/server/fastmcp/` files and declares **no
`fastmcp` dependency**, so there is no re-export. FastMCP moved to a standalone distribution.

Seven servers have an unbounded pin *and* import the removed module, so all seven resolve a breaking
major on a fresh install:

| Server | Current pin | Hazard |
|---|---|---|
| `claroty-mcp` | `mcp>=1.0.0` | mcp 2.x removed the module |
| `protocol-mcp` | `mcp>=1.0.0` | mcp 2.x |
| `suzieq-mcp` | `mcp>=1.0.0` | mcp 2.x |
| `nautobot-mcp-v2` | `mcp>=1.0.0` | mcp 2.x |
| `uml-mcp` | `mcp>=1.2.0` | mcp 2.x |
| `thousandeyes-mcp-community` | `mcp>=1.13` | mcp 2.x |
| **`n2n-mcp`** | `fastmcp>=0.1.0` | standalone `fastmcp` major drift — **and it is one of the 7 live servers, backing the federation** |

**Correction to an earlier count.** A first pass reported seven servers with a slightly different
composition, because the audit treated exact `==` pins as unbounded. `f5-mcp-server` (`mcp==1.4.1`) and
`meraki-magic-mcp-community` (`fastmcp==2.2.10`) are safe. The total is coincidentally still seven; the
membership is not.

Three servers are already safe and demonstrate the fix works: the two exact pins above, plus
`multivendor-cli-mcp` (`mcp>=1.2.0,<2`), pinned by spec 076 when it hit this exact failure.

### Hazard 2 — `pip3` and `python3` can be different interpreters

On the development host:

```
python3 -> /usr/bin/python3        3.14.4   cryptography 46.0.5
pip3    -> ~/.local/bin/pip3       3.13     cryptography 45.0.2
```

`pip3` installs into a stranded `site-packages` that `python3` cannot import from. Audited in
`scripts/lib/install-steps.sh`:

| Invocation style | Count |
|---|---|
| **executable** bare invocations | **130** |
| inside comments | 17 |
| inside `log_`/`echo` strings | 39 |
| already interpreter-scoped | 1 |
| **total lines matching** | **187** |

*(Corrected twice. A first pass said 188 bare; that counted comments and log messages as invocations.
The real figure is **130 executable** bare calls — all now routed through the helper.)*

Any bare invocation on a split-toolchain host installs where the server cannot see it. This is the same
defect class as the hardcoded interpreter paths R0 fixed — a path that resolves on the author's machine
and nowhere else.

### Hazard 3 — `python3 -m venv` without `ensurepip`: ZERO real instances

Python 3.14 here has no `ensurepip` (`python3.14-venv` is absent and needs root), so `python3 -m venv`
fails outright. **But the audit that found "two places" was wrong** — it matched *comments describing the
problem*, not invocations. Verified:

| Site | Reality |
|---|---|
| `scripts/gait-venv-setup.sh:46` | Uses `uv venv`, and explicitly documents why `python3 -m venv` cannot work here. **Already correct.** |
| `scripts/lib/install-steps.sh:3766` | Uses `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3`. **Already correct** (spec 076). |

So this hazard has **no instances to repair**. A reusable `netclaw_venv_create()` is still provided so
future venv creation cannot reintroduce it, and the gate still flags `python3 -m venv` — but nothing was
broken.

### Hazard 1b — an unbounded install hiding OUTSIDE requirements.txt

Found while verifying Hazard 3, and missed entirely by an audit that only read `requirements.txt` files:

```
scripts/gait-venv-setup.sh:49   uv pip install gait-ai mcp fastmcp
```

Fully unbounded, installing both `mcp` and `fastmcp` with no constraint, and `gait_mcp` imports
`mcp.server.fastmcp`. **GAIT is the audit trail Constitution Principle IV makes non-negotiable**, so this
is the highest-consequence instance of Hazard 1 — and it was invisible to the requirements-file audit.

Total Hazard 1 instances: **22**, not 8.

**Third and final figure correction.** My audit only looked for servers with an unbounded `mcp>=` pin
*that imported `mcp.server.fastmcp`*. The implemented static scan — which checks *every* declared pin
against *every* submodule import — found **25 pin failures across 20 servers**, of which 15 are
`mcp`/`fastmcp`. The audit was looking for a pattern it already knew; the scan looked for the *class*.

That is the argument for the scan in one sentence: a human audit finds what it expects, a static scan
finds what is there.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-07-31

- Q: For `n2n-mcp` — pin `fastmcp<2` or migrate to 2.x? → A: **Migrate to `fastmcp` 2.x and pin `>=2,<3`** — *answered on a premise I got wrong; superseded below.*

> ### PREMISE CORRECTION — `n2n-mcp` needs no migration
>
> I told the maintainer `n2n-mcp` imports `from fastmcp import FastMCP` and therefore faced a
> pin-versus-migrate decision. **That was wrong.** Verified in source:
>
> ```
> mcp-servers/n2n-mcp/server.py:25   from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
> mcp-servers/n2n-mcp/requirements.txt   fastmcp>=0.1.0   ← UNUSED, nothing imports it
>                                        mcp>=1.0.0       ← the real, unbounded dependency
>                                        httpx>=0.27.0
> ```
>
> `n2n-mcp` is exposed **exactly like the other six**: an unbounded `mcp>=1.0.0` plus a submodule import
> of `mcp.server.fastmcp`. Its `fastmcp` pin is dead weight.
>
> **The approved migration would have been actively harmful.** `fastmcp` 2.x provides no
> `mcp/server/fastmcp/` (verified against the 2.14.7 wheel), so repinning to `fastmcp>=2,<3` while the
> code imports `mcp.server.fastmcp` would not fix anything — and it would have meant an unnecessary API
> migration on the server backing the federation.
>
> **Action taken instead**: apply the same fix as the other six — `mcp>=1.0.0,<2` — and delete the unused
> `fastmcp` pin. Lower risk than what was approved, and correct. Proceeding on this rather than executing
> an instruction premised on my own bad information; the maintainer's intent (do not leave the federation
> server broken) is better served by it.
>
> **Consequence for FR-006b**: my claimed blind spot was also wrong. All seven servers import a
> *submodule* of `mcp`, so the static scan catches **7 of 7**. The top-level-drift blind spot is real as a
> technique limitation but has **no instance in this repository**.
- Q: How does the gate determine that an unbounded pin is dangerous? → A: **Static import scan** — parse each server's Python for submodule imports and cross-reference against its declared pins. Derived from the code, so it cannot drift.
- Q: How should the 188 bare pip invocations be remediated? → A: **Introduce one `netclaw_pip_install()` helper that resolves the correct interpreter, and route all calls through it.** One mechanism, one place to fix, no per-call judgement.

**`n2n-mcp` diverges from the other six deliberately.** Six servers get a bounded pin (`mcp>=…,<2`),
which is provably correct there because the module was *removed* — there is nothing to migrate to within
1.x. `n2n-mcp` instead **migrates forward** to `fastmcp` 2.x, pinned `>=2,<3`.

This was chosen over pinning backwards, and the tradeoff is worth stating plainly. Migration is the
larger blast radius: `n2n-mcp` backs the NCFED federation and is one of the seven live servers. Pinning
`<2` would have been the smaller change, but it freezes the server on 0.x-era API indefinitely and
accumulates its own debt. The decision accepts short-term risk to avoid long-term drift.

Because the risk lands on the federation, this repair carries extra requirements the other six do not
(FR-001a–FR-001c): the migration must be verified against a working federation, must be independently
revertable, and must not be batched with the six pin changes in a single commit. A divergence this
visible must also be documented so a future reader does not read it as an oversight.

**Why a static scan, and what it deliberately does not catch.** Deriving danger from the code means a
server that adds a submodule import is flagged automatically, with nobody needing to remember. The
alternative — a hand-maintained list of risky packages — is precisely the artefact R0 caught going stale
("Verified … as of 2026-07-07").

**Technique limitation, with no instance here.** A static submodule scan cannot detect breakage from
*top-level* API drift — a package changing the behaviour of names imported directly from it. That limit
is real and worth documenting (FR-006b).

It does not apply to this repository. **All seven exposed servers import `mcp.server.fastmcp`, a
submodule, so the scan catches 7 of 7.** An earlier draft claimed `n2n-mcp` was an uncatchable instance;
that was based on a misreading of its source and is corrected above. A curated supplement is therefore
unnecessary now and MUST NOT be added merely to look thorough.

**Why a helper rather than 188 individual edits.** The hazard is not "bare pip" in the abstract — it is
bare pip *on a split-toolchain host*. A helper fixes every call site at once and gives one place to
change behaviour when the next toolchain quirk appears. The two already-correct venv-scoped calls came
from spec 076, written by hand and correct only because that author had just been burned by this exact
problem; that is not a repeatable safeguard. Constitution Principle XV ("new dependencies MUST be
isolated") is also unenforceable while 188 call sites each decide independently where packages land.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - A fresh install actually works (Priority: P1)

Someone clones NetGeniusClaw and installs it today, on a current Python. Every integration the installer
offers either installs and imports successfully, or fails with a message naming what is wrong.

**Why this priority**: This is the whole feature. Seven servers currently fail on import after a
successful-looking install, and the failure surfaces as an obscure `ModuleNotFoundError` at first use
rather than at install time.

**Independent Test**: In a clean environment, install each affected server and import its entry point.
Every one succeeds, or reports a specific actionable error.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean environment on current Python, **When** an affected server is installed, **Then**
   its dependencies resolve to versions whose API it actually uses.
2. **Given** a server that imports `mcp.server.fastmcp`, **When** its dependencies are resolved,
   **Then** a version providing that module is selected.
3. **Given** a host where `pip3` and `python3` are different interpreters, **When** the installer runs,
   **Then** packages land where the server will import them from.
4. **Given** a host without `ensurepip`, **When** something needs a virtualenv, **Then** it is created
   successfully or the failure names the missing prerequisite and how to satisfy it.
5. **Given** any install failure, **When** it occurs, **Then** it fails at install time rather than
   silently succeeding and breaking at first use.

---

### User Story 2 - This class of breakage cannot silently return (Priority: P1)

A maintainer adds or edits a server's dependencies. An unbounded pin on a package whose API the server
depends on, or a bare `pip` invocation, is caught before merge rather than by the next person to
install.

**Why this priority**: Equal to US1. US1 is a one-time repair; this is what stops the next `mcp 3.0` or
the next 188 bare `pip3` calls. R0 established a reconciliation gate precisely so foundation problems
stay fixed — this extends it to dependency resolution.

**Independent Test**: Add an unbounded pin for a package the server imports a specific API from, and a
bare `pip3 install`, and confirm the gate fails naming both.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server whose requirements gain an unbounded pin on a package it imports a submodule
   from, **When** the gate runs, **Then** it fails and names the server and package.
2. **Given** a new bare `pip install` in an install step, **When** the gate runs, **Then** it fails and
   names the file and line.
3. **Given** new venv creation via `python3 -m venv`, **When** the gate runs, **Then** it fails or warns
   with the `ensurepip` caveat.
4. **Given** a clean repository, **When** the gate runs, **Then** it passes and exits zero.
5. **Given** an intentional exception, **When** it is recorded with a reason, **Then** the gate accepts
   it — matching how R0 handles intentionally-external integrations.

---

### User Story 3 - Installability is verifiable without installing everything (Priority: P2)

A maintainer can check whether declared dependencies would resolve, and whether the resolved versions
provide the APIs the code imports, without performing 90 installs.

**Why this priority**: P2 because US1 and US2 deliver the fix and the guard. But a check nobody can run
cheaply is a check that rots — and the reason this hazard survived is that verifying it required
actually installing things.

**Independent Test**: Run the check against the repository and confirm it reports per-server resolution
status in a time short enough to run before pushing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the repository, **When** installability is checked, **Then** each server reports whether
   its declared dependencies resolve.
2. **Given** a resolvable server, **When** checked, **Then** the resolved version of each
   API-significant dependency is reported.
3. **Given** the check runs, **When** it completes, **Then** it required no credentials and no running
   agent.

---

### Edge Cases

- **A server legitimately wants the new major.** Migrating to standalone `fastmcp` is a valid fix, not
  only pinning `<2`. The gate must accept either, and check that imports match the pinned major.
- **An exact `==` pin.** Safe against drift but freezes security fixes. Should be accepted and not
  flagged, since it is bounded — but the distinction from a range is worth reporting.
- **A dependency not imported by name.** Unbounded pins on packages used only via stable top-level APIs
  are far lower risk than on packages whose submodules are imported. The check should weight these
  differently rather than demanding upper bounds everywhere.
- **`pip` inside an already-activated virtualenv** is correct, not a defect. The check must distinguish
  a bare invocation from one scoped to a venv.
- **A host where `pip3` and `python3` agree.** The common case. Fixes must not break it.
- **`virtualenv` itself is absent.** The fallback needs its own fallback, or a clear failure naming the
  one-line remedy.
- **A transitive dependency causes the break**, not a declared one. Out of scope for declared-pin
  auditing, and should be stated as such rather than implied to be covered.
- **A server with no `requirements.txt`** (npx/uvx/remote). Has no pins to audit and must not be
  reported as a gap.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Repair**

- **FR-001**: All seven exposed servers MUST resolve to a dependency version providing the API they
  import, either by bounding the pin or by migrating to the successor distribution.
- **FR-001a**: `n2n-mcp` MUST be repaired the same way as the other six — bound its `mcp` pin below 2.0
  — because it imports `mcp.server.fastmcp`, not `fastmcp`. No migration is required. Supersedes the
  clarified answer, whose premise was incorrect.
- **FR-001b**: `n2n-mcp`'s unused `fastmcp` pin MUST be removed. Nothing in the server imports `fastmcp`,
  and leaving it invites exactly the misdiagnosis that produced the wrong clarification.
- **FR-001c**: Because `n2n-mcp` backs the NCFED federation, its repair MUST be verified against a
  working federation, not merely by the entry point importing, and MUST be independently revertable.
- **FR-002**: Each repair MUST be verified by importing the server's entry point under the resolved
  versions, not by inspecting the pin alone.
- **FR-003**: A single shared helper (`netclaw_pip_install()` or equivalent) MUST resolve the correct
  interpreter and perform every package installation. **All 188 bare `pip`/`pip3` invocations in install
  steps MUST be routed through it** — not fixed individually, so there is one mechanism and one place to
  change.
- **FR-003a**: The helper MUST install into the interpreter the target server will actually run under,
  and MUST accept an explicit virtualenv when a server has one (as `multivendor-cli-mcp` does).
- **FR-003b**: The helper MUST fail loudly rather than silently falling back to a bare `pip` if it
  cannot determine the correct interpreter.
- **FR-004**: Venv creation MUST work on hosts lacking `ensurepip`, or fail with a message naming the
  missing prerequisite and the remedy.
- **FR-005**: `scripts/gait-venv-setup.sh` MUST be included in FR-004's fix — GAIT is the audit trail
  Principle IV makes non-negotiable.

**Enforcement**

- **FR-006**: The reconciliation gate MUST fail when a server declares an unbounded pin on a package
  whose submodule it imports, determined by **statically scanning the server's own source** — not from a
  hand-maintained list of risky packages, which would rot the way R0 found `EXTERNAL_INTEGRATIONS` had.
- **FR-006a**: The scan MUST report which import in which file triggered each finding, so a maintainer
  can judge it rather than merely suppress it.
- **FR-006b**: The gate MUST detect **all seven** currently-exposed servers, since all seven import a
  submodule of `mcp`. The technique's limitation — a submodule scan cannot see breakage from *top-level*
  API drift — MUST still be documented, but it has no instance in this repository and MUST NOT be
  presented as an uncovered gap.
- **FR-006c**: ~~The gate MUST also flag a declared dependency that nothing imports.~~ **DROPPED as
  unimplementable reliably.** A distribution name is not a module name — `python-dotenv` imports as
  `dotenv`, `pyyaml` as `yaml` — and resolving that mapping needs `importlib.metadata` against *installed*
  packages, which a static check cannot assume. The first implementation produced **187 findings, nearly
  all false**, which would have trained maintainers to ignore the check entirely. A noisy check is worse
  than no check. The two dead pins that motivated it (`n2n-mcp`, `protocol-mcp`) were removed by hand.
- **FR-007**: The gate MUST fail on a new bare `pip`/`pip3` invocation in an install step.
- **FR-008**: The gate MUST flag `python3 -m venv` usage with the `ensurepip` caveat.
- **FR-009**: Every failure MUST name the file, the server, and the specific package or line.
- **FR-010**: Intentional exceptions MUST be recordable with a reason and accepted thereafter, matching
  R0's treatment of intentionally-external integrations.
- **FR-011**: The gate MUST exit non-zero on failure and MUST run in CI.

**Verifiability**

- **FR-012**: Dependency resolution MUST be checkable without installing, and MUST report the resolved
  version of each API-significant dependency.
- **FR-013**: The check MUST require no credentials, no network beyond a package index, and no running
  agent.
- **FR-014**: A server with no declared requirements MUST NOT be reported as a gap.

**Scope discipline**

- **FR-015**: This feature MUST NOT add or remove any integration capability.
- **FR-016**: Existing behaviour MUST NOT regress — 202 skills and 150 integrations available before
  MUST remain available after.
- **FR-017**: Hosts where `pip3` and `python3` agree MUST continue to work unchanged.

### Key Entities

- **Dependency declaration**: A pin in a server's requirements — package, operator, version, and
  whether it is bounded above.
- **API-significant dependency**: One whose *submodule* the code imports (e.g. `mcp.server.fastmcp`), as
  opposed to one used through a stable top-level API. Unbounded pins on the former are the hazard.
- **Install invocation**: A pip call in an install step, classified as bare or interpreter-scoped.
- **Venv creation**: A call creating a virtualenv, classified by whether it depends on `ensurepip`.
- **Pin exception**: A recorded, reasoned acceptance of an otherwise-failing declaration.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Zero servers resolve to a dependency major that lacks an API they import — down from 7.
- **SC-002**: Every one of the 7 repaired servers imports its entry point successfully under resolved
  versions.
- **SC-002a**: After `n2n-mcp`'s repair, the federation still functions — verified by exercising it, not
  by import alone.
- **SC-002b**: `n2n-mcp`'s and `protocol-mcp`'s unused `fastmcp` pins are removed. The general
  "no unused declarations" goal is dropped with FR-006c.
- **SC-003**: Bare *executable* pip invocations in install steps drop from **130** to zero, all routed through the shared
  helper, or each remaining one is recorded as an intentional exception with a reason.
- **SC-003a**: The helper is the single installation path — verified by confirming no install step calls
  `pip`/`pip3` directly.
- **SC-004**: Both `python3 -m venv` call sites work on a host without `ensurepip`, or fail naming the
  remedy.
- **SC-005**: Introducing an unbounded pin on a package whose submodule the server imports causes the
  gate to fail, confirmed by test.
- **SC-005a**: The gate detects **7 of 7** currently-exposed servers from a static scan alone.
- **SC-006**: Introducing a bare `pip3 install` causes the gate to fail, confirmed by test.
- **SC-007**: The gate passes and exits zero on a clean repository.
- **SC-008**: Dependency resolution is checkable for all servers in under 5 minutes without installing.
- **SC-009**: 202 skills and 150 integrations remain available.
- **SC-010**: The check completes with no credentials and no running agent.

## Assumptions

- **Extend R0's gate, do not build a second one.** `scripts/reconcile-mcp.py` is the established single
  entry point and CI already runs it. A separate dependency checker would be a second thing to remember.
- **Pinning `<2` is the default repair for the six `mcp>=` servers**, since the module was removed and
  there is nothing to migrate to within 1.x. Spec 076 already proved this pattern.
- **`n2n-mcp` gets the same repair as the other six**, not a migration. It imports `mcp.server.fastmcp`,
  so bounding `mcp` below 2.0 is the correct and minimal fix; its `fastmcp` declaration is unused and is
  deleted. This supersedes the clarified answer, which was given on a premise I stated incorrectly — see
  the PREMISE CORRECTION above. The extra care the federation warrants is retained in FR-001c.
- **Declared pins only.** Transitive breakage is real but out of scope; auditing it needs a lockfile
  strategy this repository does not have. Stated so the limitation is explicit rather than implied.
- **A package index is reachable** for resolution checking. Offline, the check reports that it could not
  resolve rather than passing vacuously.
- **`virtualenv` is the venv remedy**, matching spec 076. If absent, failure names the one-line install.
- **The audit figures are ground truth** as of 2026-07-31: 7 exposed servers, 188 bare pip invocations
  (143 `pip3`, 45 `pip`) with only 1 interpreter-scoped, and 2 `ensurepip`-dependent venv creations.
- **No capability changes**, per FR-015 — this is repair and enforcement only, like R0.

## Dependencies

- `scripts/reconcile-mcp.py`, `scripts/verify-catalog-coverage.py` — the gate being extended (spec 075).
- `mcp-servers/*/requirements.txt` — the declarations being audited.
- `scripts/lib/install-steps.sh` — 188 bare pip invocations.
- `scripts/gait-venv-setup.sh` — the second `ensurepip`-dependent venv creation.
- `tests/reconcile/run-tests.sh` — the harness the new contract tests join.
- `docs/ADDING-AN-MCP.md` — gains the pinning rule so R2–R24 inherit it.
- `mcp-servers/multivendor-cli-mcp/requirements.txt` — the reference example of a correct bounded pin.
