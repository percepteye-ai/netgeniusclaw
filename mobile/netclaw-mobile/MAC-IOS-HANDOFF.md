# NetGeniusClaw Mobile — Mac / iOS Handoff

**Read this first on the Mac.** It replaces the throwaway kickoff prompt from the
2026-07-23 Android session (which was written to a scratchpad and lost — hence
this file lives in the repo now).

Last updated: **2026-07-25**, at the end of the Android verification pass.

## Where things stand

The Android/Dart/Python side of specs **066** (NCFED edge node), **067**
(mobile command channel) and **068** (biometrics/capture) is done, merged, and
— as of 2026-07-25 — **verified against the real production Border with a real
round trip from an emulated phone**.

Merged: **#159, #161, #162, #163** (the 066→067→068 stack), **#164**
(branding/icon, persisted reconnect, first real end-to-end proof, HUD phone
glyph), **#166** (heartbeat, stale-answer recovery, session-key fix, manual
enrollment fallback, HUD edge-node liveness), **#170** (orphaned-task cancel).

Pull `main` and confirm **#170** is merged before starting.

### Proof the stack works end to end

From 2026-07-25 13:04–13:06 local, a question typed on the emulated phone
("check the CML lab R1 interfaces, test them and report back") produced:

| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| 13:04:33 | Edge WS accepts the ask, capability negotiate (proto 053) |
| 13:04:46 | `cml-lab-lifecycle` → member `johns-risk/cml` completed |
| 13:04:59 | Router picks `pyats-health-check` → `johns-risk/pyats`, GAIT logged |
| 13:06:10 | pyATS returns `in_scope/success` |
| 13:06:46 | 1583-byte answer delivered to the handset — **2m13s end to end** |

Enrollment, edge WS transport, delegation, routing, GAIT audit, and result
delivery are all real. iOS is the only unproven platform.

## What's already built (verify/wire up on iOS — do not rebuild)

Everything under `mobile/netclaw-mobile/`:

- **`EdgeIdentity`** (`lib/ncfed/edge_identity.dart`) — platform-channel
  interface. iOS native side is `ios/Runner/EdgeIdentityPlugin.swift` (Secure
  Enclave keygen/signing) and `ios/Runner/X509SelfSigned.swift` (manual
  self-signed cert builder — iOS has no equivalent of AndroidKeyStore's cert
  convenience). **Both were written without a Mac and are entirely unverified.**
  This is the actual iOS work: get them compiling, generate a real Secure
  Enclave key, sign real challenge nonces, build a real X.509 cert from it.
  The Secure Enclave does not exist on the Simulator — you need a real device
  for keygen/signing. Simulator is fine for build + UI sanity.
  - Android's working equivalent is
    `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../MainActivity.kt` — read it as the
    reference implementation. It is confirmed to link and run on a real
    emulator, so its shape is trustworthy.
- **`AppDelegate`/`SceneDelegate`** — Android needed `FlutterActivity` →
  `FlutterFragmentActivity` for `local_auth`. Confirm whether iOS needs an
  analogous change (it likely does not).
- **Everything else is pure Dart** and should behave identically on iOS:
  enrollment (QR *and* manual), ask/chat, approvals, capture UI, capability
  registration, heartbeat, persisted reconnect.
- **App icon/splash** via `flutter_launcher_icons`/`flutter_native_splash` from
  `assets/icon/icon.png`. The generator targets both platforms, but the iOS
  icon has never been eyeballed on a device. See `ASSETS.md`.

## Corrections to the old draft — these are now FIXED, don't go hunting

The 2026-07-23 prompt listed three gaps. Two are closed:

1. ~~Session-key bug: `n2n-edge-{member_id}` breaks on `/`~~ — **FIXED.**
   `bgp/federation/service.py:1289` now does
   `"n2n-edge-" + member_id.replace("/", "_")`. Shipped in #166.
2. ~~Enrollment is QR-scan-only with no manual fallback~~ — **FIXED.**
   `lib/screens/manual_enrollment_screen.dart` exists; `enrollment_screen.dart`
   offers "Can't scan? Enter manually" (domain/port/token fields). Shipped in
   #166. **This matters for you specifically** — it's the clean way past
   enrollment on the iOS Simulator, which has no usable camera. You no longer
   need the `integration_test/enrollment_and_ask_test.dart` trick.
3. **Face ID / `NSFaceIDUsageDescription`** — still open, still unverified.
   The key is in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` but no real Face ID prompt has ever
   fired. Confirm on a real device.

## Known defects — pre-existing, not yours

If you hit these on iOS, they are not iOS bugs and not something you introduced.

- **Empty result payloads survive a crash as a clean "completed".** Two
  independent holes, both found 2026-07-25:
  - `bgp/federation/audit.py:30-38` `store_result()` writes results
    non-atomically (no temp+`os.replace`+`fsync`), and returns the path even
    when the write raised. A host reboot inside the ext4 delayed-allocation
    window leaves a **0-byte** result file. Confirmed twice on this box
    (2026-07-24 14:14 and 2026-07-25 11:47, each ~12s before a reboot).
  - `bgp/federation/tasks.py:139-146` `result()` swallows the resulting JSON
    parse failure with a bare `except: pass`, returning
    `{"state": "completed"}` with no `output_text`, no `error`, and no log
    line. A lost payload is indistinguishable from a skill that returned
    nothing. `service.py:1593` then re-caches that empty reply over the
    Border's own good copy.
  - Also on that line: `resp.get("completed_at")` is always `None` because
    `TaskManager.result()` never returns the field — every outbound task row
    has `completed_at=NULL`.
  - Fourth path: `gateway.py:123-125` returns `("", 0)` when the agent CLI
    emits no stdout at all, bypassing the `"(no reply text…)"` fallback at
    `gateway.py:184`; `tasks.py:65-68` records that as `completed`.
- **Operator-side cancel doesn't notify the phone.** #170 fixed the phone's own
  Cancel button (`invocation.py:232-254` pushes `n2n/edge/ask_result` with
  `state:"cancelled"`), but the HTTP route `bgp-daemon-v2.py:422-423` returns
  `{"cancelled": …}` without the push. Cancel a stuck `edge_ask` from the
  HUD/CLI and the phone sits on "Working…" forever.
- **`ReconnectSupervisor` ignores revocation.** `reconnect_supervisor.dart:55`
  is a bare `catch (_)` that backs off forever, so a device revoked *while
  running* retries a dead enrollment indefinitely instead of returning to the
  enrollment gate. `isRevokedByBorder()` (`edge_client.dart:22-31`, added in
  #170) exists but is only consulted on cold-start reconnect.
- ~~**`NotificationDeepLink` is orphaned code.**~~ **No longer true — fixed.**
  `lib/main.dart:310` (`_wireNotificationDeepLink`) instantiates it from
  `_tryRegisterPush()`'s success path, jumping to the Feed tab with the
  referenced message highlighted. Do not go hunting for this; the Dart side of
  push is complete and only the Firebase/APNs *configuration* is outstanding.

## Push notifications — read before doing APNs

**Updated 2026-07-26. Decision: push ships in v1.** The code side is finished;
what is left is configuration only, and it needs the operator's own Apple and
Google credentials.

Already done, no need to redo any of it:

- Dart is complete — `push_registration.dart` (permission → token →
  `n2n/edge/register_push`, `platform: 'apns'` on iOS) and
  `notification_deep_link.dart`, both genuinely wired from `main.dart`.
- Failures are classified (`classifyPushError`) and shown on the Settings tab
  instead of vanishing into a `debugPrint`.
- Android: the `com.google.gms.google-services` plugin is declared and applied
  **conditionally on `android/app/google-services.json` existing**, so a clone
  without credentials still builds. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is declared explicitly.

**iOS work remaining — this is yours:**

1. Create/obtain the Firebase project and download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   into `ios/Runner/` (gitignored).
2. Generate an **APNs auth key** (`.p8`) in the Apple Developer portal and
   upload it to Firebase → Project settings → Cloud Messaging.
3. In Xcode, Runner target → Signing & Capabilities → add **Push
   Notifications** and **Background Modes → Remote notifications**. A
   prepared `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` is in the repo but deliberately
   **not** referenced by `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` — see the comment inside it.
4. **A free Personal Team cannot sign the Push Notifications capability.** Step
   3 requires paid Apple Developer Program membership, and doing it early will
   break the device builds that currently work. Sequence accordingly.

The core product (enrollment → ask → answer) still works without any of this.

## How to verify for real

Match the rigor of the Android pass — actually run it, don't just green the tests.

1. `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` clean (platform-agnostic, should already pass).
2. Xcode build → Simulator (UI/layout, manual enrollment path) → **real device**
   (Secure Enclave, Face ID, camera).
3. Enroll against the operator's real Border: **`N2N_EDGE_WS_PORT=8443` is
   permanently live** and confirmed serving as of 2026-07-25 13:00
   (`Edge WS listener on 0.0.0.0:8443`, risk `johns-risk`). You should not need
   to enable anything. For an isolated run instead, follow the throwaway-Border
   pattern in `specs/068-ncfed-mobile-biometrics-capture/quickstart.md`.
4. Close out the two remaining manual-verification tasks if iOS is the platform
   you do them on:
   - `specs/066-netclaw-mobile-ncfed-edge/tasks.md:121` — **T045**, full
     `quickstart.md` walkthrough steps 1–10 against a live Border.
   - `specs/067-ncfed-mobile-command-channel/tasks.md:72` — **T017**, confirm a
     federated-peer request is attributed to the external peer in the
     conversation. Note: the three eN2N peers (`as65007`, `as65008`, `as65099`)
     have been connection-refused all week — you need a reachable peer first.
5. Update `README.md`'s iOS section and 066 T044's iOS note once verified. Be
   honest about verified vs. still-assumed, the way the Android section is.

## Environment gotchas learned the hard way

- **`JAVA_HOME` must point at JDK 17.** The Gradle/AGP/Kotlin combination in
  this project (Gradle 9.1.0, AGP 9.0.1, Kotlin 2.3.20, `JvmTarget.JVM_17`)
  fails confusingly on newer JDKs. On the Mac, expect the same class of
  problem and pin JDK 17 for Android builds. (Irrelevant for the iOS target
  itself, relevant the moment you build Android from the Mac.)
- `mobile/netclaw-mobile/build` reaches **2.2 GB** and `.dart_tool` **334 MB**.
  Both are gitignored; don't copy them to the Mac, just `flutter pub get`.
- The repo is a **shared checkout** — other agents switch branches in it. Verify
  the branch before committing.

## Store-release status (Android, applies to iOS App Store too)

> **This section was rewritten 2026-07-26 — the 2026-07-25 version was stale.**
> It claimed R8 was off and the `applicationId` undecided; both had already been
> fixed. Do not act on any cached memory of those claims.

The user intends to publish, and **the Android release config is now nearly
shippable**:

- ✅ `applicationId` is `ca.automateyournetwork.netclaw.mobile` — final, and
  identical to the iOS bundle ID. **Permanent once published.**
- ✅ **R8/minify and resource shrinking are on**, with real keep rules in
  `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`.
- ✅ `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` are declared explicitly rather than arriving
  as manifest-merge side-effects.
- ⚠️ **Release signing is still the one open technical item.** The Gradle
  plumbing reads `android/key.properties` and falls back to the debug key with a
  warning when absent — but no keystore has ever been generated, so every build
  to date is debug-signed. See `android/key.properties.example`.
- Resolved SDK levels: `compileSdk 36`, `targetSdk 36`, `minSdk 24` (from the
  Flutter SDK defaults). **API 36 is already correct** for Google's
  2026-08-31 deadline — no change needed.
- `pubspec.yaml:19` — `version: 1.0.0+1` → `versionName 1.0.0`, `versionCode 1`.

**Decisions since made (2026-07-26):** Play account type is **Personal**, which
accepts the 12-testers × 14-continuous-days closed-testing gate; and **push
ships in v1** rather than being stripped, so APNs (Firebase project + APNs auth
key + Push Notifications/Background Modes capabilities in Xcode) is now real
iOS-side work rather than a deferred question.

Full path to publication and timelines:
[`PLAY-STORE-ROADMAP.md`](PLAY-STORE-ROADMAP.md),
[`APP-STORE-ROADMAP.md`](APP-STORE-ROADMAP.md). For getting builds onto real
phones before either store, see [`SIDELOAD.md`](SIDELOAD.md).

Work through this the same way the Android pass did: implement, test for real,
be honest in the docs about what's verified vs. still assumed, and open a PR
when done.
