# Feature Specification: Auvik API MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `036-auvik-mcp-server`
**Created**: 2026-06-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Add an Auvik API MCP server + skills to NetGeniusClaw covering network alerts, inventory, lifecycle, and performance — read-only, multi-tenant (MSP), built from the attached Auvik OpenAPI 3.0.1 definition.

## User Scenarios & Testing

<!--
  Read-only network-monitoring server. Four user journeys map 1:1 to the four
  requested themes. Each is independently testable and delivers standalone value;
  Inventory (P1) is the foundation the other three build on.
-->

### User Story 1 — Multi-tenant inventory & discovery (Priority: P1)

An MSP NetGeniusClaw operator needs to enumerate the devices, networks, interfaces, and components Auvik has discovered across one or many client tenants, drill into a single asset's details, see the device's billing/usage rollup, and read the notes and audit history attached to any entity. The operator refers to assets the way humans do — by name, hostname, IP address, or the customer/"site" they belong to — and almost never knows the opaque Auvik ID. The tools MUST therefore accept those human-friendly identifiers and resolve them to the correct Auvik ID(s) internally.

**Why this priority**: Asset visibility is the foundation of every other Auvik workflow. Without an inventory — and without name/IP-based resolution — the operator cannot reason about alerts, lifecycle posture, or performance for a given device.

**Independent Test**: With a valid `AUVIK_USERNAME` / `AUVIK_API_KEY`, invoke the `auvik-inventory` skill with "show full details for core-sw-01 at the Dallas client" and verify the tool resolves the name (and tenant) to a device ID and returns the device's attributes — without the operator supplying any Auvik ID.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configured Auvik tenant, **When** the operator asks "list the first 50 devices for the Dallas client", **Then** the tool resolves "Dallas client" to its tenant (by name / domain prefix) and `auvik_list_devices(tenants=<resolved>, page_first=50)` returns a TOON device table.
2. **Given** the operator knows only a hostname, **When** they ask "show full details for core-sw-01", **Then** the tool resolves `core-sw-01` (via `filter[deviceName]`, walking all pages) to its device ID and returns the extended detail — no ID supplied by the operator.
3. **Given** a name fragment that matches several devices, **When** the operator asks "show details for the core switch", **Then** the tool returns the candidate matches (id, name, IP, deviceType, tenant) and asks the operator to disambiguate rather than guessing.
4. **Given** the operator knows only an IP, **When** they ask "what is core-sw-01's billed usage" or "usage for 10.4.1.1", **Then** the tool resolves the device by name/IP and `auvik_get_usage(scope="device", device_id=<resolved>)` returns the usage record.
5. **Given** a network referred to by name, **When** the operator asks "show notes on the Guest VLAN network", **Then** the tool resolves "Guest VLAN" to its network ID and `auvik_list_entity_notes(filter_entity_id=<resolved>)` returns the note set.
6. **Given** the user has access to several client tenants, **When** the operator asks "which tenants can I see?", **Then** `auvik_list_tenants()` returns the multi-client/client catalog (the operator-facing source of truth for tenant names used in resolution).

---

### User Story 2 — Network alert monitoring & triage (Priority: P2)

A NOC operator needs to surface the alerts Auvik has triggered across tenants, filter by severity / status / dismissed-state / time window, and drill into a single alert to read its full detail (triggering entity, alert definition, message).

**Why this priority**: Alert monitoring is the highest-frequency day-to-day operator action, but it is interpreted against the inventory from User Story 1 (an alert references a device/interface/network).

**Independent Test**: With a valid key, invoke the `auvik-network-alerts` skill with "show all unresolved critical alerts in the last 24 hours" and verify the response is a severity-sorted alert table with detected timestamps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** active alerts in Auvik, **When** the operator asks "list all critical, non-dismissed alerts", **Then** `auvik_list_alerts(filter_severity="critical", filter_dismissed=false)` walks all result pages and returns a severity-sorted table.
2. **Given** the operator wants alerts for a named device, **When** they ask "show alerts for core-sw-01", **Then** the tool resolves `core-sw-01` to its entity ID and `auvik_list_alerts(filter_entity_id=<resolved>)` returns that device's alerts.
3. **Given** an alert surfaced in a prior list, **When** the operator asks "show the full detail for that alert", **Then** `auvik_list_alerts(alert_id=<id from list>)` returns the single alert's attributes (the ID originates from a tool result, not the operator's memory).
4. **Given** a time window, **When** the operator asks "what alerted in the last 24 hours?", **Then** `auvik_list_alerts(filter_detected_time_after=…, filter_detected_time_before=…)` returns the complete windowed alert series across pages.

---

### User Story 3 — Performance & SNMP statistics (Priority: P3)

A performance analyst needs to pull Auvik's monitored statistics — device CPU/memory/availability, interface throughput, service and component metrics, and custom SNMP poller values — over a time range and interval, to spot saturation and trends.

**Why this priority**: Performance analysis is high value but lower frequency than inventory or alerting, and it requires the operator to already know which device/interface to inspect (from User Story 1).

**Independent Test**: Invoke `auvik-performance` with "show interface throughput for Gi0/1 on core-sw-01 over the last hour at 1-minute intervals" and verify the tool resolves the device + interface names to an interface ID and returns a timestamped statistics series — with no Auvik ID supplied by the operator.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a device under monitoring, **When** the operator asks "show CPU for core-sw-01 over the last hour", **Then** the tool resolves `core-sw-01` to its device ID and `auvik_get_device_statistics(stat_id="cpuUtilization", device=<resolved>, from_time=…, thru_time=…, interval="hour")` returns a stats series.
2. **Given** a device, **When** the operator asks "is core-sw-01 up?", **Then** `auvik_get_device_statistics(stat_id="availability", device=<resolved>, …)` (deviceAvailability) returns the uptime series.
3. **Given** an interface named in human terms, **When** the operator asks "throughput on Gi0/1 of core-sw-01", **Then** the tool resolves the device + interface to an interface ID and `auvik_get_interface_statistics(...)` returns the series.
4. **Given** a poller referenced by name, **When** the operator asks for its history, **Then** the tool resolves the poller/device name and `auvik_get_snmp_poller_history(value_type="int", …)` returns the complete numeric history across pages.
5. **Given** a configured poller, **When** the operator asks "what SNMP pollers are configured and on which devices?", **Then** `auvik_list_snmp_poller_settings(with_devices=true)` returns the settings and their device bindings.

---

### User Story 4 — Asset lifecycle & warranty posture (Priority: P4)

An asset manager needs to review Auvik-collected lifecycle data — sales availability, last-day-of-support, software/security maintenance status — plus warranty/service coverage and the device configuration-backup history, to plan refresh and renewals.

**Why this priority**: Lifecycle/warranty reporting is periodic (planning cycles) rather than daily, and like performance it is anchored to the device inventory from User Story 1.

**Independent Test**: Invoke `auvik-lifecycle` with "list devices whose support has ended" and verify the response includes makeModel, lastSupportStatus, and end-of-life dates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** devices with lifecycle data, **When** the operator asks "which devices are past end-of-support?", **Then** `auvik_list_device_lifecycle(filter_last_support_status=...)` walks all pages and returns the complete matching set.
2. **Given** devices with warranty data, **When** the operator asks "what is covered under warranty?", **Then** `auvik_list_device_warranty(filter_covered_under_warranty=true)` returns the covered set across all pages.
3. **Given** a device with config backups, **When** the operator asks "show the configuration backup history for core-sw-01", **Then** the tool resolves `core-sw-01` to its device ID and `auvik_list_configurations(filter_device_id=<resolved>)` returns the backup history (metadata, with the config payload available for a single backup by ID).

---

### Edge Cases

- **Auth missing/invalid**: missing `AUVIK_USERNAME` or `AUVIK_API_KEY` → server fails fast at start with a logged ERROR; an invalid key surfaces the upstream 401 via `auvik_verify_credentials` rather than a silent empty result.
- **Rate limiting (HTTP 429)**: the client honors `Retry-After` and retries with backoff up to a bounded number of attempts; the sliding-window limiter caps outgoing requests.
- **Multi-page result sets (primary case)**: Auvik routinely returns far more results than a single page holds. By default the tools transparently follow the JSON:API `next` cursor and aggregate **all** pages up to a configurable safety cap (`AUVIK_MAX_PAGES` / max-records), so the operator gets a complete answer rather than a silently truncated first page. When the cap is hit, the response explicitly signals truncation and returns the `next` cursor so the operator can continue.
- **Cursor pagination end**: when Auvik returns fewer items than `page[first]` or an empty `next` link, the paginator stops cleanly.
- **Identifier resolution — ambiguous**: when a name / hostname / IP / partial string matches more than one entity (e.g., the same hostname under two tenants), the tool MUST return the candidate set (id, name, IP, type, tenant) and ask the operator to disambiguate — it MUST NOT silently pick one.
- **Identifier resolution — no match**: when nothing matches the supplied identifier (within the chosen tenant scope), the tool returns a clear "no <entity> matching '<input>'" message, not an empty success or a guessed ID.
- **Identifier resolution — spans pages**: resolution searches walk all result pages (within the cap), so a match that lives on a later page is still found rather than missed because it was past page one.
- **Identifier already an Auvik ID**: if the operator (or a prior tool result) does supply a real Auvik ID, the resolver detects the ID shape and uses it directly, skipping the lookup.
- **Wrong region/base URL**: a base URL pointing at the wrong Auvik regional cluster returns 401/404 — surfaced as a clear error, not retried indefinitely.
- **Multi-tenant scope**: when `tenants` is omitted, the query uses the API key's accessible tenant scope; an operator without access to a requested tenant receives the upstream 403/empty set, reported plainly.
- **Invalid statistics request**: an unknown `stat_id`, an inverted time range, or an unsupported `interval` returns the upstream 400 — the tool returns the error dict, no retry.
- **Large result sets**: list tools default to a bounded page size and return cursor metadata so the operator can page rather than overloading a single response; TOON serialization keeps token cost down.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Inventory (User Story 1)**
- **FR-001**: System MUST list devices with `detail_level` (info | detail | extended) and filters (deviceType, makeModel, vendorName, onlineStatus, manageStatus, networks, notSeenSince, dateAdded range), and MUST fetch a single device by ID **or by a resolved name / hostname / IP (per FR-024)**.
- **FR-002**: System MUST list networks with `detail_level` (info | detail) and filters (networkType, scope), and MUST fetch a single network by ID.
- **FR-003**: System MUST list interfaces with filters (interfaceType, parentDevice, adminStatus, operationalStatus) and MUST fetch a single interface by ID.
- **FR-004**: System MUST list components with filters (deviceId, componentType) and MUST fetch a single component by ID.
- **FR-005**: System MUST list accessible tenants (multi-client and client), optionally with detail, and MUST fetch a single tenant's detail by ID.
- **FR-006**: System MUST list entity notes and entity audits with filters (entityType, entityId, lastModifiedBy / category, status, detected-time range), each fetchable by ID.
- **FR-007**: System MUST return client-scope and device-scope billing usage (`scope` = client | device, optional `device_id`, date filters).

**Alerts (User Story 2)**
- **FR-008**: System MUST list alert-history records with filters (severity, status, dismissed, dispatched, detectedTime range, entityId, alertDefinitionId) and MUST fetch a single alert by ID.
- **FR-009**: System MUST NOT expose any alert-dismiss or other write operation; the server is strictly read-only (per operator decision and the read-only-preferred standard).

**Performance (User Story 3)**
- **FR-010**: System MUST return device statistics (including device availability) for a `stat_id`, time range, and interval, filterable by device — the device identified by name / IP and resolved to its ID (per FR-024), not requiring a raw ID.
- **FR-011**: System MUST return interface, service, component, and OID statistics for a `stat_id`, time range, and interval, filterable by the relevant entity, resolved from a human-friendly identifier (per FR-024).
- **FR-012**: System MUST list SNMP poller settings (optionally with their bound devices) and fetch a single poller setting by ID.
- **FR-013**: System MUST return SNMP poller history for string and numeric value types over a time range/interval.

**Lifecycle (User Story 4)**
- **FR-014**: System MUST list device lifecycle records (salesAvailability, lastSupportStatus, software/security maintenance status) and fetch a single device's lifecycle by ID.
- **FR-015**: System MUST list device warranty/service records (coveredUnderWarranty, coveredUnderService) and fetch a single device's warranty by ID.
- **FR-016**: System MUST list device configuration-backup history (filters: deviceId, backupTime range) and fetch a single configuration by ID including its payload.

**Cross-cutting**
- **FR-017**: System MUST authenticate to Auvik using HTTP Basic auth with `AUVIK_USERNAME` and `AUVIK_API_KEY` (API key as password), read from environment at runtime (never hardcoded).
- **FR-018**: System MUST target a configurable regional base URL via `AUVIK_BASE_URL` (default `https://auvikapi.us1.my.auvik.com`), supporting other regions (eu1/au1/…).
- **FR-019**: Every list tool MUST accept an optional `tenants` parameter for MSP multi-client scoping and MUST support JSON:API cursor pagination (`page[first]`, `page[after]`, `page[before]`, `page[last]`).
- **FR-019a**: List tools MUST, by default, transparently follow the `next` cursor and aggregate results across **all** pages up to a configurable safety cap (`AUVIK_MAX_PAGES` / max records). They MUST NOT silently return only the first page. When the cap truncates the result, the response MUST flag truncation and return the continuation cursor. A single-page mode (explicit `page_first` + cursor) remains available for callers that want manual paging.
- **FR-020**: System MUST cap outgoing requests with a sliding-window rate limiter (`AUVIK_RATE_LIMIT`) and MUST honor `Retry-After` / back off on HTTP 429.
- **FR-021**: System MUST serialize tool responses through the TOON helper (Feature 006) to minimize token usage, preserving an option for raw JSON.
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide `auvik_verify_credentials` (`/v1/authentication/verify`) as an auth/health check.
- **FR-023**: System MUST register as a FastMCP stdio server implementing the standard MCP lifecycle (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`) and MUST NOT break any existing MCP server or skill.

**Identifier resolution (cross-cutting — User Stories 1–4)**
- **FR-024**: For any tool that targets a specific entity (device, network, interface, component, configuration, tenant, SNMP poller) or filters by one (e.g., alert `entityId`, stats `deviceId`/`interfaceId`, usage `device`), the tool MUST accept a human-friendly identifier — name, hostname, IP address, or partial string — and resolve it to the correct Auvik ID internally using the appropriate `filter[...Name]` / IP endpoints. The operator MUST NOT be required to know or supply an Auvik ID.
- **FR-025**: When an identifier resolves to more than one entity, the tool MUST return the candidate matches (id, name, IP, type, tenant) for disambiguation and MUST NOT auto-select. When it resolves to none, the tool MUST return a clear "no match" message (not an empty success or a guessed ID).
- **FR-026**: Resolution lookups MUST honor the active `tenants` scope and MUST search across all pages (per FR-019a) so matches beyond the first page are found. If the supplied value already matches the Auvik ID shape, the resolver MUST use it directly and skip the lookup.

### Key Entities

- **Device**: id, name, ipAddresses, deviceType, makeModel, vendorName, serialNumber, onlineStatus, manageStatus, networkId, lastSeen, firstSeen (info → detail → extended attribute tiers).
- **DeviceLifecycle**: deviceId, salesAvailability, lastSupportStatus, softwareMaintenanceStatus, securitySoftwareMaintenanceStatus, end-of-life / end-of-support dates.
- **DeviceWarranty**: deviceId, coveredUnderWarranty, coveredUnderService, warranty/service expiry.
- **Network**: id, networkType, scope, description, deviceCount.
- **Interface**: id, interfaceType, parentDevice, adminStatus, operationalStatus, macAddress.
- **Component**: id, deviceId, componentType, name, attributes.
- **Configuration**: id, deviceId, backupTime, configType, contents (single-fetch payload).
- **Tenant**: id, domainPrefix, tenantType (multiClient | client), name.
- **EntityNote / EntityAudit**: id, entityType, entityId, author/user, timestamp, body/action.
- **Alert**: id, alertDefinitionId, severity, status, dismissed, dispatched, entityId/entityType, detectedTime, message.
- **Statistic**: statId, entity reference, interval, series of {time, value} points (device/interface/service/component/OID/availability).
- **SnmpPollerSetting / SnmpPollerHistory**: pollerSettingId, deviceBindings, oid, value series (string | numeric).
- **Usage**: tenant/device scope, period, billed device counts/metrics.
- **ResolutionCandidate** *(internal)*: the shape returned when a name/IP/partial identifier is ambiguous — { id, name, ipAddress, entityType, tenant } — so the operator can pick the intended entity. "Site" in operator language resolves to a **tenant/client** (by name or domain prefix) and/or a **network**; the resolver handles both.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: An operator can list, filter, and inspect any Auvik-discovered device across a chosen tenant in fewer than 3 chat turns, **referring to it only by name, hostname, or IP** — never an Auvik ID.
- **SC-002**: 0 write operations exist in the server — verified by source inspection (no POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH tool) and by smoke test in `quickstart.md`.
- **SC-003**: When list calls are issued concurrently above the configured limit, the sliding-window limiter prevents any 429 from reaching the user (or it is transparently retried via `Retry-After`).
- **SC-004**: Adding Auvik does not regress any existing skill — a representative existing skill smoke (e.g. `pyats-health-check` or `suzieq` list) continues to pass after the merge.
- **SC-005**: The Coherence Checklist in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` passes with every box ticked; the artifacts touched are enumerated in `checklists/requirements.md`.
- **SC-006**: All four skills (`auvik-network-alerts`, `auvik-inventory`, `auvik-lifecycle`, `auvik-performance`) resolve their documented tools and return TOON-formatted output for at least one representative query each.
- **SC-007**: For every single-entity / entity-scoped tool, supplying a device/network/interface name or IP resolves to the correct ID with zero operator-supplied IDs; an ambiguous identifier returns candidate matches for disambiguation (verified by a resolver smoke test in `quickstart.md`).
- **SC-008**: A list query whose result spans multiple Auvik pages returns the **complete** set (up to the safety cap), not just the first page — verified by paging a query known to exceed one page and confirming the aggregated count and truncation flag behavior.

## Assumptions

- The operator has a valid Auvik user + API key with the role permissions required for the read APIs in scope, and the key's tenant scope covers the tenants they query.
- ASM (SaaS Management) endpoints are **out of scope** for v1 (operator decision); they may be added in a follow-up spec.
- Billing/Usage endpoints are **in scope** and surfaced through the `auvik-inventory` skill as a billing view of inventory (no separate skill).
- Configuration-backup history is grouped under the **lifecycle** theme (device change history) rather than inventory.
- The default regional cluster is `us1`; other regions are reached by overriding `AUVIK_BASE_URL`.
- TOON serialization, cursor pagination, and the sliding-window rate limiter follow the existing `azure-network-mcp` / `claroty-mcp` conventions and are not reinvented.
- Identifier resolution relies on Auvik's name/IP `filter[...]` query parameters (e.g., `filter[deviceName]`, `filter[entityName]`, `filter[name]`) plus IP matching; Auvik has no first-class "site" object, so a "site" maps to a tenant/client (name or domain prefix) and/or a network, which the resolver disambiguates.
- Because resolution and reporting both depend on seeing every result, full multi-page aggregation (FR-019a) is a default behavior, bounded by a safety cap to protect token budget and avoid runaway paging.
- Exact Auvik rate-limit numbers and the enumerated statistics `statId` / `interval` vocabularies will be confirmed from the Auvik API documentation during the research/plan phase and recorded in `research.md`.
