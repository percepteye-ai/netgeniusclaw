"""Multivendor CLI Driver — MCP server entry point.

Spec 076 (roadmap R1). Contract:
specs/076-multivendor-cli-driver/contracts/mcp-tools.md

Gives NetClaw a general "connect to this device and ask it something" capability.
Before this server, all four device-facing servers were platform-bound — pyATS
(Cisco), junos-mcp (Juniper), gnmi-mcp (telemetry only), radkit-mcp
(cloud-relayed) — leaving ~90 platform families unreachable: MikroTik, VyOS,
SONiC, Nokia SR Linux, Extreme, Huawei, Dell, Ubiquiti EdgeOS.

ROUTING — this server is NOT a replacement for pyATS or junos-mcp:

  Cisco IOS/XE/NXOS/XR ......... pyATS       (far richer, ~2000 Genie parsers)
  Juniper Junos ................ junos-mcp   (PyEZ/NETCONF)
  Streaming telemetry .......... gnmi-mcp
  No direct reachability ....... radkit-mcp
  Everything else .............. THIS SERVER
  Cross-vendor normalized reads. THIS SERVER (read-only, even on the above)

Writes stay single-pathed per platform: this server REFUSES configuration change
on platforms owned by another server (FR-010). That is what keeps Principles I
and VIII enforceable — "verified by which tool?" must have one answer.

MUST run from this server's dedicated virtualenv. `napalm`/`netmiko` resolve
cryptography 49.x while the system interpreter carries 46.x, which NetClaw's
NCFED federation stack uses for X.509 issuance (spec 060). Running this outside
its venv risks the certificate stack, not this server (FR-030a, research R7).

STATUS: stub. Created early per analyze finding O1 — the tool implementations
land in later phases, but without an entry point none of them would be reachable
over MCP, so no story phase would be independently testable as an MCP capability.
Tools are registered here as they are implemented.
