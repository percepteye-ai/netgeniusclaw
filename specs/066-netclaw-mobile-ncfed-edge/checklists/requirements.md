# Specification Quality Checklist: NCFED Edge Node Foundation + Border-to-Phone Push Channel

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This spec was restructured mid-clarification: the original draft covered all three
  NetGeniusClaw Mobile directions (Border→phone push, phone→Border commands, biometrics/capture).
  A `/speckit.clarify` session resolved that these should be three separate specs; this file
  now covers **Direction 1 only** (protocol foundation + push channel). Specs 067 (command
  channel) and 068 (biometrics/capture) carry the rest, built on this spec's foundation.
- Seven questions were resolved across two clarification passes (both recorded under
  Clarifications, not left as markers): BASE_FLOOR exemption, member-side reconnect
  supervision, the 3-way spec split itself, the cert trust model (reusing feature 060
  asymmetrically), push-message scope (explicit-designation only, not a full mirror),
  where Border-initiated capture belongs (068, not here), and eN2N reachability from the
  phone (resolved for spec 067's benefit, though not this spec's requirements).
- One point worth flagging explicitly for planning: FR-003's enrollment trust model is
  mutual via two *different* mechanisms — the phone verifies the Border's public
  domain-verified certificate (feature 060); the Border's verification of the phone is the
  phone's proof of possessing the single-use enrollment token encoded in the same QR code
  (only ever displayed on the Border's own screen) — not a bare, unauthenticated first
  connection. TOFU key-pinning only governs connections *after* that verified exchange.
- Like specs 064/065, this feature is protocol-shaped — federation, node types, and transport
  bindings are the domain itself, not incidental implementation choices — so requirements
  reference these concepts by name (`node_type`, WebSocket, heartbeat) without specifying
  concrete wire formats, code structures, or the mobile framework's internal architecture.
- Mobile app store submission/CI-CD and iOS code-signing (which requires macOS/Xcode) are
  explicitly out of scope per the Assumptions section — the operator has confirmed a separate
  Mac (same git repo) is available for that side when needed.
